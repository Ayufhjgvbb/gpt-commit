```
Refactor: Improve performance of the login feature by optimizing the authentication flow.
```

### Example 2: Using a Specific Model

If you want to use CodeLlama, you can specify it like this:
```bash
gpt-commit "Fix typo in README" --model CodeLlama
```
Output:
```
Fix: Corrected a typo in the README file to enhance clarity.
```
